## How to report a bug

Report bugs on the [Issue Tracker].

When filing an issue, make sure to answer these questions:

- Which operating system and Python version are you using?
- Which version of this project are you using?
- What did you do?
- What did you expect to see?
- What did you see instead?

The best way to get your bug fixed is to provide a test case,
and/or steps to reproduce the issue.

## How to request a feature

Request features on the [Issue Tracker].

## How to contribute a feature

Create an issue on the [Issue Tracker] describing the proposed changes. This will allow a chance to talk it over and validate your approach. Make a separate branch, please make sure it has a descriptive name that starts with either the fix/ or feature/ prefixes, for instance, `fix/docs` or `feature/new_storage`. Follow the instructions [here](#how-to-submit-changes) to submit the changes.

## How to set up your development environment

You need Python 3.8+ and the following tools:

- [Poetry]
- [Nox]
- [nox-poetry]

Install the package with development requirements:

```console
$ poetry install
```

You can now run an interactive Python session,
or the command-line interface:

```console
$ poetry run python
$ poetry run epic-stream-processor
```

[nox]: https://nox.thea.codes/
[nox-poetry]: https://nox-poetry.readthedocs.io/

## How to add new message types
Add service and message definitions to the ```epic_image.proto``` file and run the following command in the ```epic_grpc``` module folder
```bash
$ python -m grpc_tools.protoc -I./ --python_out=. --mypy_out=. --mypy_grpc_out=. --grpc_python_out=. epic_image.proto
```

## How to test the project

Run the full test suite:

```console
$ nox
```

List the available Nox sessions:

```console
$ nox --list-sessions
```

You can also run a specific Nox session.
For example, invoke the unit test suite like this:

```console
$ nox --session=tests
```

Unit tests are located in the _tests_ directory,
and are written using the [pytest] testing framework.

## How to submit changes

Open a [pull request] to submit changes to this project. Make sure you have a descriptive commit message.

Your pull request needs to meet the following guidelines for acceptance:

- The Nox test suite must pass without errors and warnings.
- Include unit tests. This project maintains 100% code coverage.
- If your changes add functionality, update the documentation accordingly.
- You have only one commit (if not, squash them into one commit).

Feel free to submit early, thoughâ€”we can always iterate on this.

To run linting and code formatting checks before committing your change, you can install pre-commit as a Git hook by running the following command:

```console
$ nox --session=pre-commit -- install
```
